ABOUT
=====

This is a game created by Stephen Molyneaux between December 22 and 28, 2012. 
It is a clone of the iOS game Bloop by @rustym. It was made using libgdx and 
the Universal Tween Engine.


HOW TO PLAY
===========

The game can be played many ways. The intended way to play is for each player, up to
4 players, to pick a color, press their own color while attempting to prevent other 
players for pressing theirs.

Players can decide on their own rules for how many hands they can use and how physical
the game can get (ex. no grabbing each other's hands, can use both hands but only one
can press at a time, etc).
